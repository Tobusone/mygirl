                        My beuatiful girlfriends name is Courtney, and I actually knew her for a while
                        before she actually became my girlfriend. It wasnt until
                        we at a festival over new years in 2023 when I realised that i was going
                        to take her away with me forever. Although she was reluctant and only became close with me 
                        for reasons that I was unaware of at the time, through persistance and determination i managed to 
                        persuade her for me to become more than just a gay best friend. 
                        <br><br>
                        I was finding any excuse in the book to get her to hang out with me. 
                        In the first few times she came over Courtney had already trimmed my beard with a razor more 
                        times than i had myself. It's safe to say that I knew Courtney was the one from the very moment
                        I saw her over New Years and nothing could stop her getting away from me.

                <p class="text1">There are too many reasons I like my girlfriend to put into words but there are a few that I can name.
                    The main reason I like my girlfriend is because she makes me laugh more than anybody that I know. She can 
                    make me laugh just by looking at me and smiling. Just thinking of her makes me giggle. <br><br>
                    Something I like about Courtney is the love and interest she has in the animals around us. She has befriended
                    every one of my chickens, she's eaten raw deer meat and deer heart, she's brought home an exotic bird from the
                    Amazon, she's had snakes slither all over her and every time we go to my dads office she begs to pet the bearded dragon.
                    She is pretty amazing and I'm glad I've found a girl that doesn't squirm at the site of an insect, however I do still need to cure 
                    her Arachnaphobia. <br><br><br><br><br>

                    I like hanging out with her because I know it can be just the two of us and we will still have so much
                    fun, even if we are just lying in bed all day. She never ceases to amaze me with how much 
                    she knows and im always learning something from her, whether she's showing me something she knows or if we are 
                    both trying something together for the first time, I love cookie cups. Courtney never fails to correct me when 
                    im wrong but it's okay because sometimes i do forget who the boss is so im glad she keeps me on my toes.

                    Even though we both love to relax and have a lazy day in bed , we also like 
                    to get out and experience the world together. We have been to festivals together, we like to go out to the city and go to friends gatherings, we've been to the races,
                    the zoo, markets, been on road trips and we have much more to come.
                    My favourite adventure was when we spent a long weekend in Phillip Island in a caravan park sleeping in my car. It was the most fun i've had all year.
                    We watched the little penguins swim ashore and run onto the beach and hated on all the tourists blinding them with their flashlights. <br><br><br>

                    <br><br>It might not still be my favourite trip by the end of the year because we are about to go on our first overseas trip together 1Of course we go on cute dates every 
                    now and then however we are long overdue for one at the moment. 
                    My amazing girlfriend had the cutest idea for a date where we buy each other clothes to wear from a 
                    second hand shop and go out on a date, of course she looked like the cutest girl in the whole world. Although we basically live together every day we tried 
                    house sitting 2 times. I think we could both agree the first time probably could've gone better but after the second time I didn't want it to end and I knew we could do it 
                    together forever. <br> <br>

                    <br>From the outside if you see Courtney she looks like an adorable little princess but once you spend enough time with her,
                    you will find that she has an unuasally large amount of gas build up for her size that she isn't afraid of letting go of 
                    at any time during the day, usually in the close quarters of the bedroom with her unsuspecting boyfriend.
                    <br><br>
                    Apart from that anyone that knows Courtney would know that she is a princess. Her favourite colour is pink and she loves cats.
                    I don't think she actually owns a normal pair of undies however she does own 5 of every colour g-string that there is.
                    Courtney is going to be working with actual psycopaths which is a bit scary but i'm very proud of her because she is a smart 
                    cookie and she has a bright future ahead of her (with me). I'm looking forward to the days where she gets to be my nurse, I'm very excited
                    for our future, she is the best girlfriend i could've ever asked for even though she is a little crazy sometimes. Love you to pieces my munchkin
